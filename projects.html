                <p class="project-description">
                    This C++ program implements a graph-based system to find the shortest path between locations in Gauteng, South Africa, using Dijkstra's algorithm. 
                    The program defines a graph with 103 nodes, each representing a location, and edges representing the distances between them. The Node structure is used to create a linked list for each node, 
                    representing its connections to other nodes. The create_gauteng_graph function initializes the graph with predefined connections and distances. Users input a start and end location, and the program 
                    calculates the shortest path using the dijkstra function, which returns the shortest distances and the previous node for each node in the path. The reconstruct_path function is used to trace back the shortest 
                    path from the end node to the start node, and the print_shortest_path function displays the path and its total distance. The program also maps node indices to location names for user-friendly output. This program 
                    could be used for applications such as route planning, navigation systems, or educational tools to demonstrate graph algorithms.
